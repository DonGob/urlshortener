to install all packages using pip run the following in the command line (while in this directory): 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

If you use conda you can create a conda environment using: 'conda env create -f environment.yml'
you have then created an environment called 'assignmentAC' which you can access by typing: 'conda activate assignmentAC'

you can run the server by typing 'python manage.py runserver' in the command prompt (in the current directory)

the cmd should now print a message indicating the server has been started
